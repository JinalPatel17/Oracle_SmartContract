# Oracle_SmartContract
Oracle_SmartContract

This is smart contract using Oracle integration. The whole purpose of this project is to learn about Oracle's progress in blockchain and Cloud Computing.
This project is just for knowledge gain by practicing a real-time project.

The project consists of getting real-time etherum value on a device without surfing the internet.

Tools:
1) Remix IDE
2) Alchemy
3) CoinMarketCap
4) MetaMask

Methodology:
>> The Smart contract on Remix will deploy first.
>> The Contract address can reterive from there and will put it in py file which will call back to Oracle.sol to retreive the ETH price in USD.

## Make sure to change this following things for personal use,

> Replace the placeholder for the my_account variable with your actual Ethereum account address.
> Replace the placeholder for the private_key variable with your actual private key.
